# Compile and Deploy the contrats

Lets compile the contracts and create an application binary interface to be able to propose solutions to the contract&#x20;

* &#x20;Run the following in the project's root directory to compile your contract&#x20;

```bash
npm run compile
```

* Deploy the contracts by running a local instance of the builder on port http://0.0.0.0:3554

```bash
npm run chain
```
